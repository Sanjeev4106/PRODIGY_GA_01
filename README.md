# PRODIGY_GA_01
This project demonstrates how to fine-tune GPT-2, a transformer-based language model by OpenAI, on a custom dataset to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. The fine-tuned model learns to mimic the style, tone, and structure of the training data, enabling it to produce creative and domain-specific outputs from a given prompt.
